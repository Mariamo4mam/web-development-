    <p>
        A commonly used hacking definition is the act of compromising digital devices and networks through unauthorized
        access to an account or computer system. Hacking is not always a malicious act, but it is most commonly
        associated with illegal activity and data theft by cyber criminals.
        Hacking definition: What is hacking?

        Hacking refers to activities that seek to compromise digital devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets,
        and even entire networks. And while hacking might not always be for malicious purposes, nowadays most references
        to hacking, and hackers, characterize it/them as unlawful activity by cybercriminals—motivated by financial
        gain, protest, information gathering (spying), and even just for the “fun” of the challenge.

        Who are hackers?
        Many think that “hacker” refers to some self-taught whiz kid or rogue programmer skilled at modifying computer
        hardware or software so it can be used in ways outside the original developers’ intent. But this is a narrow
        view that doesn’t begin to encompass the wide range of reasons why someone turns to hacking. To learn about the
        various motivations different types of hackers might have, read Under the hoodie: why money, power, and ego
        drive hackers to cybercrime. Also, check out our Malwarebytes Labs’ podcast episode, interviewing hacker Sick
        Codes:



        Hacking tools: How do hackers hack?
        Hacking is typically technical in nature (like creating malvertising that deposits malware in a drive-by attack
        requiring no user interaction). But hackers can also use psychology to trick the user into clicking on a
        malicious attachment or providing personal data. These tactics are referred to as “social engineering.”

        In fact, it’s accurate to characterize hacking as an over-arching umbrella term for activity behind most if not
        all of the malware and malicious cyberattacks on the computing public, businesses, and governments. Besides
        social engineering and malvertising, common hacking techniques include:

        Botnets
        Browser hijacks
        Denial of service (DDoS) attacks
        Ransomware
        Rootkits
        Trojans
        Viruses
        Worms

    <h2> Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet
        (a
        private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex
        web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. </h2> <br>

    <h3> Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web
        design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that
        works over the internet i.e. websites.
        The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is: <br>

        Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet. <br>
        Development: It refers to building the application from scratch. <br>
        Web Development can be classified into two ways:</h3> <br>

    <h4> Frontend Development <br>
        Backend Developme <b><b>
                Frontend Development </h4><br>
    The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the
    ‘client side’ of the application.
    <br>
    <strong> Frontend Roadmap </strong> <br> <br>
    <h3> Popular Frontend Technologies </h3> <br>
    <h3>HTML:</h3>
    <h4>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using markup
        language. It acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the structure of a website.</h4>
    <h3>CSS:</h3>
    <h4>Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process
        of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.</h4>
    <h3>JavaScript:</h3>
    <h4> JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website.</h4> <br>
    <h3>Bootstrap:</h3>
    <h4>Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is
        the most popular CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. Nowadays, the websites are
        perfect for all browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and
        Phones).</h4>

    <h2>Backend Development </h2> <br>
    <h3>Backend is the server side of a website. <br> It is part of the website that users cannot see and interact with.
        It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and
        arrange data. </h3>

    <h3>Popular Backend Technologies</h3> <br>
    <h2>PHP:</h2> PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. <br>
    <h2>Java:</h2> Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. It is highly scalable. <br>
    <h2>Python:</h2> Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
